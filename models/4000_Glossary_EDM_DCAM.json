The goal is to formalize the business terminology used to describe the practice of data management. To achieve this goal, we organized a group of industry practitioners and asked them to impose rigor on the definition of terms and to provide the clarity needed to ensure consistent collaboration among organizational stakeholders. . This publishing has approximately 130 terms defined. The terms are aligned to one or more of the seven DCAM components. Many terms also have tags that create sub-groupings of related terms (i.e., data architecture, roles & responsibilities, provisioning, metadata, governance and data quality).",
